# Lazarus-SelectionSort

This small project shows how the Selection Sort algorithm can be implemented in Pascal. This example was built using the [Lazarus IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_(software)).

**ToDo**: Right now the numbers to sort are hard coded. In the future, they should be generated randomly.
